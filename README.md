RSS FEED

A simple RSS feed app that fetches data from an API and displays them for the user to see and click on to access the articles. It includes pagination and skeleton loading of the news cards.

P.S. There is a bug in the program that I have not solved yet. The code functions incorrectly when I disable/hide the skeleton loading cards which is why they are always visible.
